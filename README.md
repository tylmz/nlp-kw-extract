# Keyword extraction and Tagging with NLP 
Natural language processing and information retrieval keyword extraction project.

Keywords and keyphrases (multi-word units) are widely used in large document collections.
They contain the content of single documents and provide a kind of semantic metadata that is useful for a wide variety of purposes.
The task of assigning keyphrases to a document is called keyphrase indexing.
On the Internet, keywords are the key option for search engine optimization (SEO).  With the help of well chosen keywords, return and popularity of the web sites increases. Key phrases are essential to SEO success. Choosing the right ones can mean major traffic and visibility to your prospective customers!
There are lots of keyword extraction and meta tagging applications on the internet but many of them just indexes the related document and randomly chooses keywords.
For example:lets look the sentence which;  'i m the lord commander of nightwatch' . With a randomly keyword extraction algorithm the keywords
might be **'i' , 'm', 'the'** or **'of'** for this sentence but in return there is nothing beneficial for a SEO with these keywords.
When you are embarking on your SEO journey, the first part of your strategy always includes creating a key phrase plan. Itâ€™s important to pick the right key phrases!
To handle this problem we have to build a *keyword extractor* which learns , analyse and suggest better and wisely chosen keywords for meta tagging. 


# How does keyword extraction work?
  * **Candidate selection**: Here, we extract all possible words, phrases, terms or concepts (depending on the task) that can potentially be keywords.
 
  * **Properties calculation**: For each candidate, we need to calculate properties that indicate that it may be a keyword. For example, a candidate appearing in the title of a book is a likely keyword.

  * **Scoring and selecting keywords**: All candidates can be scored by either combining the properties into a formula, or using a machine learning technique to determine probability of a candidate being a keyword. A score or probability threshold, or a limit on the number of keywords is then used to select the final set of keywords.

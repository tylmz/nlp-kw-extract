# Keyword extraction and Tagging with NLP 
Natural language processing and information retrieval keyword extraction project.

Keywords and keyphrases (multi-word units) are widely used in large document collections.
They contain the content of single documents and provide a kind of semantic metadata that is useful for a wide variety of purposes.
The task of assigning keyphrases to a document is called keyphrase indexing.
On the Internet, keywords are the key option for search engine optimization (SEO).  With the help of well chosen keywords, return and popularity
of the web sites increases. There are lots of keyword extraction and meta tagging applications on the internet but many of them just indexes
the related document and randomly chooses keywords.
For example:lets look the sentence which;  'i m the lord commander of nightwatch' . Wiht a randomly keyword extraction algorithm the keywords
might be **'i' , 'm', 'the'** or **'of'** for this sentence but in return there is nothing beneficial for a SEO with these keywords.
